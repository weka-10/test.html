         <p><h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1> 
            Artificial intelligence has made it possible to deposit cheques from the comfort of your home. AI is proficient in deciphering handwriting, making online cheque processing practicable. The way fraud can be detected by observing users' credit card spending patterns is also an example of artificial intelligence</p>
        <p>An Introduction to Artificial Intelligence:
            Reactive Machines. Reactive machines are the simplest level of robot. ...
            Limited Memory. A limited memory machine, as the name might suggest, is able to retain some information learned from observing previous events or data. ...
            Theory of Mind. ...
            Self-awareness.</p>
            <p><h1>Can artificial intelligence be dangerous?</h1>
                The AI is programmed to do something devastating: Autonomous weapons are artificial intelligence systems that are programmed to kill. In the hands of the wrong person, these weapons could easily cause mass casualties. Moreover, an AI arms race could inadvertently lead to an AI war that also results in mass casualties.</p>

<p><h1>  Intelligence Artificial in Education </h1>Students can benefit from using AI technology to make some learning tasks easier. Translating languages in real time, for example, makes knowledge more accessible for students globally. It also helps accelerate comprehension for students learning a second language.</p>
